# Hello
## This is my portfolio website, which is a work in progress at the moment.
The goal of this project is as with any other Front End project I undertake, to grow my skills. 
1. I have started using BEM naming convention for the first time ever in this project and am still learning.
  * The BEM proved to be a great solution to synchronize the naming of the classes in CSS
  * As the name says, Block Element Modifier helps to distinguish different elements from each other at a first glimpse
  * I think that in connection with SASS ( next thing to learn ) it will be even more powerfull 
2. CSS transitions and animations
  * transitions proved to be a simple and fast solution for small animations that do not require conditions
  * keyframes on the other hand are allowing me to control single and multiple paramaters at once, throughout the whole animation process 
3. JavaScript optimizations
  * To write less code and make it more ellegant and clean I've used object to hold the repeating variables and use dynamic evaluation.
  * dynamic evaluations are than compared to switch cases and called accordingly
  * I am still solving the click and hover functions to work as intended - the solution I came up with is to redesign but with using a block diagram to plan first
